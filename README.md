ember-vo-tasklist [STUB]
==============================================================================

Tasklist addon.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
ember install @lblod/ember-vo-tasklist
```


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This addon provides the management of tasklists.
This addon has as the extra feature of tasklists which can be re-used.
Therefore, a decoupling from the tasklist vs. the completion of a task has been designed.

See model files for more information about the model.

There is minimal css, which can be imported in host app styles/app.scss:

`@import 'ember-vo-tasklist';`

Make sure your model files are availble too in the host app.

Tasklist and its solutions should be saved manually

TODO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As said, this is only a stub implementation. Only an already existing tasklist can be completed.
So there is a lot todo before being a fullblown tasklist management addon.
The templates are pretty basic too.
